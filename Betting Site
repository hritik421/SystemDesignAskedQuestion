Develop the solution for the "Betting system" where users can bett for different kind of sport events
 
Overview of the application logic:
 
The system should provide the opportunity for users to make betts for different kind of sport events like games or matches.
 
The user should have a personal account inside the system.
The user can deposit money to his account and make betts from this account.
Any user can make unlimited amount of betts to any of sport events that presented in the system limited by BettDeadline (see below).
 
From the other side the system should operate with sport events. 
Each event that presented in the system should be categorised by type of sport (Football, Basketball etc.)
Each event should contain the field such as BettDeadline, after this date, betts won't be acceptable for it.
Each event should contain the MaxBettAmount and MixBettAmount as limitation for a bett.
